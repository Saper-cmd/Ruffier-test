"'A module for calculating the Ruffier test result.

Ideally, the sum of pulse rate shall be measured in three attempts (before the physical exertion, immediately after it, and after a short rest)
should not exceed 200 beats per minute. 
We suggest the children measure their pulse for 15 seconds 
and bring the result to beats per minute, multiplying it by 4:
    S = 4 * (P1 + P2 + P3)
The further this result from the ideal 200 beats is, the worse.
Traditionally, tables are given for a value divided by 10. 

Ruffier Index   
    IR = (S - 200) / 10
is estimated by the table according to one's age:
        7-8             9-10                11-12               13-14               15+ (for teenagers only!)
exl.     < 6.5           < 5                 < 3.5               < 2                 < 0.5  
good    >= 6.5 and < 12   >= 5 and < 10.5       >= 3.5 and < 9        >= 2 and < 7.5        >= 0.5 and < 6
satisf.  >= 12 and < 17    >= 10.5 and < 15.5    >= 9 and < 14         >= 7.5 and < 12.5     >= 6 and < 11
weak  >= 17 and < 21    >= 15.5 and < 19.5    >= 14 and < 18        >= 12.5 and < 16.5    >= 11 and < 15
Ð³nsatisf.   >= 21           >= 19.5             >= 18               >= 16.5             >= 15

for all ages, the difference between the unsatisfactory and weak results is 4, 
the difference between the weak and satisfactory results is 5, and the difference between the good and satisfactory results is 5.5

therefore, let's code the ruffier_result(r_index, level) function that would receive
the calculated Ruffier index and the "unsatisfactory" level for the tested person's age, and return the result
